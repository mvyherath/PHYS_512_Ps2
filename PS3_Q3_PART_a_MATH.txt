We have the equation:

z-z0 = a((x - x0)^2 + (y - y0)^2)

The equation gets expanded.
z = a(x^2 + y^2) - 2ax0*x - 2ay0*y + (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2)

We separate out the unknowns from the knowns. The unknowns are called Cx where...
x is an integer
Therefore the unknowns become elements of the m matrix: 
C1 = a 
C2 = -2ax0
C3 = -2ay0
C4 = x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2

While the known quantities become elements of the A matrix
X1 = x^2 + y^2
X2 = x
X3 = y
X4 = 1

The z values go into the Y matrix.
Therefore:
Z = C1(X1) + C2(X2) + C3(X3) + C4(X4)

Once we use the sad equation and find the m matrix, we can use the values of the m.....
matrix to find the values of a, x0, y0 and z0 using the equations given above for...
The Cx values.
