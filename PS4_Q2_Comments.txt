# Both the Newton fitting method and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) methods were used
# to find the best fit parameters.
# Both fits managed to find a minimum round a chi-square value of 2700.
# Beyond that point, both fitting algorithms failed.
# Failure resulting from the Tau parameter or other parameters dropping below zero. 
# The minimum chi-sq value resulting from each fit was used for Q3.
# The reason why both the Newton and LM algorithms failed is yet to be determined. 
# Reason could be due to using a wrong value for dx.
# Reason could also be an issue with the differential matrix.
